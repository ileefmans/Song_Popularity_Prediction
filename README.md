This paper investigates whether or not a song’s popularity can be predicted via deep learning methods. This objective is attempted by applying a Convolutional Neural Network to spectrograms representing a song’s frequencies and amplitudes over time. The network predicts the popularity of out of sample songs with roughly 67% accuracy.
